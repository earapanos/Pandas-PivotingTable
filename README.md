<h1 align="center"> üêº Pandas-PivotingTable </h1>

In the routine of Data Analyst, it's very common the processes which deal with tables. Pivoting table is a process which consists in transform *columns into lines and vice versa.*

This process is very important to:

* group items/records/rows into categories;
* count the number of items in each category;
* sum the items value;
* or compute average, find minimal or maximal value etc.

<a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Pandas-PivotingTable/blob/main/pivoting-table.ipynb">Here in this code</a>, I used Pandas library to pivot a table. The objective of it was transform columns in lines <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Pandas-PivotingTable/blob/main/tabela/zon_usos2_202311301557.csv">in this table</a> and realation it with a spatial table on database to create indicators of a specific types of buildins which are allowed do build in the determinated areas.
